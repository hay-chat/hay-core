description: Analyze a question about approaches/methods without immediately implementing
---

The user is asking a genuine analytical question, NOT requesting you to implement something.

They want you to:
- Analyze and explain the approach they're asking about
- Discuss pros and cons of different approaches
- Compare alternatives thoughtfully
- Provide your expert opinion on the trade-offs
- Help them understand the implications before deciding

Examples of genuine questions:
- "Isn't it easier to do this way?"
- "Would it be better to use X instead of Y?"
- "Can't we just simplify this by doing Z?"
- "What if we approached this differently?"

DO NOT immediately start implementing. Instead:
1. Acknowledge you understand this is a question, not a request
2. Analyze the approach they're asking about
3. Explain pros and cons
4. Discuss any relevant context from the codebase
5. Ask clarifying questions if needed
6. Wait for their decision before implementing

Be thoughtful, analytical, and educational rather than action-oriented.
